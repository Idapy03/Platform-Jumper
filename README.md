# Not-IceCreamJump

## Objective and Requirements 
The project aims to create a game inspired by other games in the ‘platform jumping’ genre, ig Doodle Jump and Ice Cream Jump (see figure 1). The player controls a constantly jumping character and is trying to jump onto platforms to reach greater heights. The player controls the lateral movement of a character by tilting the board. If the character falls off the lowest visible platform, the game will be over and the highest reached height is recorded as the score for that round. 
- The program must translate the board tilting into lateral movement for the character.
- The program ‘scrolls up’ a set height as the player hits a platform, keeping the player constantly around the middle of the screen.
- The ‘power up’ bar will fill up during the game represented by the lighting up of leds. When the bar is full, the player can press a button on the DE10-lite board to get a boost which propels them upward for a set distance.
- The screen is cylindrical which means that when the character jumps out the left part of the screen it will show up in the right part of the screen and vice versa.
- The score should be visible to the player. Every time the player hits a platform it should increase the score.

The following features are optional:
- Let the ‘power up’ bar fill up every time the player collects an item in the game. 
- The score will be shown on the 7-segment hex display.
- The high scores are stored in a document.
- Create a cloudy background that scrolls with the platforms.
- Create breakable platforms which are destroyed after the player jumps on them.

Since we aim to do the advanced project we will also conduct a performance analysis towards the end.


## Solution 
We intend to develop the program in parts. We will create a directory in gitHub for this project and then create an issue for each part of the project. The initial plan is to have one person working with tilting controls, while the other works with the graphics of the background and platforms. When a person is done with their part they move to another issue. This way will make it easier to split the workload since we are not quite sure how difficult each part will be or how long it will take.




## Verification 
We intend to verify the program by thoroughly testing it. We will need to make sure that the tilting mechanics are not too sensitive for the player and that the character on the screen moves accordingly. The platform scrolling and generating will also be tested so the game is at a decent difficulty for the players. Lastly, we will compare the game mechanics we created to other similar games.  Further testing specifications might be devised both during and after the coding phase of the program.
